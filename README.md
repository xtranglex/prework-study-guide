A study guide for course prework
# <Trangs Project>

## Description

I want to learn coding as I believe technology is the future and its a worthy skill to have.This project was created to cover the basics of HTML,CSS and Javascript to get a rough idea of what they are and their functions and how altogether they create a website. I also learned how to use Github + GitBash which will be helpful for future projects + submission.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
